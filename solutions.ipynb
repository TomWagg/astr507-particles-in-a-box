    "Start off with equal kinetic energy, $E$, for $N$ particles in a square box, but random positions and moving in random directions. Follow the particles until they collide (be careful how you handle the collisions). Conserve momentum and energy in the collisions (see, e.g., Reif, 14.1-14.2, Feynman 39) and assume that the colliding particles hard spheres (in which case they experience an elastic force directed along the line connecting the center of the spheres when they touch). Alternatively, you may instead make the approximation that when they collide the particles receive a kick in a random direction in the center-of-mass frame (make sure you conserve energy and momentum!). Allow the cross section and number of particles to vary in your program. You can make the sides of the box reflecting or periodic."
