    "Start off with equal kinetic energy, $E$, for $N$ particles in a square box, but random positions and moving in random directions. Follow the particles until they collide (be careful how you handle the collisions). Conserve momentum and energy in the collisions (see, e.g., Reif, 14.1-14.2, Feynman 39) and assume that the colliding particles hard spheres (in which case they experience an elastic force directed along the line connecting the center of the spheres when they touch). Alternatively, you may instead make the approximation that when they collide the particles receive a kick in a random direction in the center-of-mass frame (make sure you conserve energy and momentum!). Allow the cross section and number of particles to vary in your program. You can make the sides of the box reflecting or periodic."

    "Demonstrate that $P=nkT$ holds for your simulations - try a few different values of $n$ and $kT$ (i.e.\\ number density and mean energy of particles). Compute the mean pressure by calculating the force per length (since 2-D) on each (or just one) side of your box.  You can do this by using the definition of pressure:  force divided by length (in 2-D), and compute the forces of each particle as it reflects off of each side (if you have periodic boundary conditions, then keep track of the momentum perpendicular to the edges as the particles jump from one side of the box to the other). The average force imparted is the average change in momentum of the particle as they reflect (or twice the momentum perpendicular to the side) divided by the average time between collistions."
